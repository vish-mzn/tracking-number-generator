## ðŸš€ Deployment

Creating app... done, â¬¢ cryptic-journey-79303
https://cryptic-journey-79303-ca2113a2dabd.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/cryptic-journey-79303.git
```
It will create a new repository and provide you a secure url to access your application.
One you have done STEP 1 that means you already created a repository within heroku env.

STEP 2 : Verify the heroku repository
```
git remote 

heroku
origin
```

STEP 3 : PUSHING to heroku repository
```
git push heroku master

this will push your local repo code to heroku app you just created
and heroku itself will take care of the build and deployment of your application
```

STEP 4 : Verify your changes are available online
```
you can access your application using the url provided by heroku at the time of project creation

https://cryptic-journey-79303-ca2113a2dabd.herokuapp.com/

Feel free to fork and extend with persistence, Redis, rate limiting, or logging for production setups.
